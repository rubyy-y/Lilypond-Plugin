# Run LilyPond

This extension is designed to help you easily execute LilyPond from Visual Studio Code.

## Features

This extension allows you to run LilyPond directly from VS Code. A **green Play button** will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the editor. Clicking the button will execute LilyPond on the currently active file.

> Note: If the button does not appear immediately after installing the extension, you can manually trigger it for the first time by opening the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), typing `>Run LilyPond`, and pressing Enter. The button will then be displayed.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not currently add any custom settings. Future updates may include configurable options for LilyPond execution.

## Known Issues

- The status bar button may not appear immediately after installation. Use the Command Palette to activate it as described above.
- Ensure that the LilyPond binary is correctly added to your system's PATH to avoid execution errors.
